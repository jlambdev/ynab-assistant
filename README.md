# YNAB Assistant

Work in progress. Bootstrapped with Create React App.

A React Single Page Application to:

-   Convert CSV files of transactions to a format that can be uploaded to the You Need A Budget web application.
-   Create YNAB CSV import files manually (pending future requirement).

## Resources

Mockups created with [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/). Note: these are out of date.

## Future consideration

-   Complete Revolut conversion example
-   Convert to Typescript
-   Make UI Cleaner
-   Provide option to directly upload to YNAB
-   Use YNAB API to fetch last updated date
-   Automation if CSV is sent via email?
