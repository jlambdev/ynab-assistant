# YNAB Assistant

Work in progress. Bootstrapped with Create React App.

A React Single Page Application to:

-   Convert CSV files of transactions to a format that can be uploaded to the You Need A Budget web application.
-   Create YNAB CSV import files manually (pending future requirement).

## Version 0.2.0 notes

-   Switch to Yarn
-   Integrate Redux, Redux-Saga and Styled Components
-   New workflow:
    1. (YNAB API?) Identify last recorded transaction date for each account; Identify if new data is needed
    2. Download CSVs from banks
    3. Convert CSVs (may need to cut from a certain date)
    4. (YNAB API?) Upload to YNAB
    5. (YNAB API?) Confirm budget balances match account balances
-   Consider integrating Circle CI
-   Make repository public
-   It's worth mentioning that this uses a personal access token, which should be generated by YNAB user?

## Resources

-   https://api.youneedabudget.com/
    -   should figure out if all of the above calls are possible! create an API test account on YNAB for PUT/PATCH requests
    -   explore delta requests: https://api.youneedabudget.com/#deltas - server_knowledge / last_knowledge_of_server
    -   advice is to reduce the load on the API server - cache, delta, plan for faults (errors / outages) and be specific with requests
    -   think about handling each of the http status codes here https://api.youneedabudget.com/#errors
    -   API uses UTC as the timezone
